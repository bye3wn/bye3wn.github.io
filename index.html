    <h1>Dear Booboosha,</h1>
    <p class="body">I know it may have not seem like I wanted to talk yesterday,
        but I actually did, but when I look back it, I can see how I was kind of
        selfish. I was learing how to code websites and stuff, then I got a facetime call
        to hop on the game. I know this doesn't change the fact that I was in the wrong, but I
        just wanted to tell you I didn't intend to play in the first place and once I was in
        it's kinda hard to get off. This doesn't change the fact that I am always thinking about
        you though because I always am. I wanted to show you that by making this webpage for you
        I just started so it might look kinda basic, but it took me 5 hours man. All I wanted to say though
        is that I love you soooo muchhh, and I always want to talk to you, so hopefully you can
        forgive me.<br><br>
        
        Sincerely,<br>
        Dudey</p>

    <p class="question">Do you forgive me?</p>
